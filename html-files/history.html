    <h2>Origin of the Name</h2>
    <p>
        The McLaren Senna carries one of the most iconic names in motorsport - very deliberately so. 
        When McLaren introduced its new "Ultimate Series" model in 2017, the company wanted a name 
        that embodied uncompromising performance, precision, and a singular focus on lap times. 
        No name represented these qualities better than Ayrton Senna.
    </p>
    <p>
        Ayrton Senna, a three-time Formula 1 World Champion, achieved the peak of his career with 
        McLaren between 1988 and 1993. During this era, he won three championship titles and built 
        a legendary connection with the team. His driving style - radically precise, technically flawless, 
        and relentlessly focused on speed - became a core part of McLaren's identity.
    </p>
    <p>
        Before officially using the name, McLaren sought approval from the Senna family and the Senna Foundation. 
        Both agreed, not only because the car was intended as a tribute, but also because it reflected Ayrton's values: 
        technical excellence, passion, and the constant pursuit of perfection.
    </p>
    <p>
        The name "McLaren Senna" was ultimately chosen because the car, though road-legal, is designed to feel 
        first and foremost like a track machine. It was meant to be as uncompromising as Ayrton Senna's approach to racing. 
        This made it the first McLaren ever to be named after a real person - an exceptional decision and a remarkable honor.
    </p>
    <p>
        Today, the McLaren Senna stands not only for extreme performance but also as a legacy: 
        a reminder of one of the greatest drivers of all time and one of the most successful eras in McLaren's history.
    </p>
    <p>
        By naming the car after Ayrton Senna, McLaren pays tribute to his extraordinary talent and enduring influence 
        on motorsport, while also embodying the same spirit of innovation and excellence that defined his career.
