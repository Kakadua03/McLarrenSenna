  <h1>History</h1>
  <h2>Origin of the name</h2>
  <p>The McLaren Senna carries one of the most iconic names in motorsport-very deliberately so. 
    When McLaren introduced its new "Ultimate Series" model in 2017, the company wanted a name that embodied uncompromising performance, 
    precision, and a singular focus on lap times. 
    No name represented these qualities better than Ayrton Senna.</p>

<p>Ayrton Senna, a three-time Formula 1 World Champion, achieved the peak of his career with McLaren between 1988 and 1993. 
  During this era, he won three championship titles and built a legendary connection with the team. 
  His driving style-radically precise, technically flawless, and relentlessly focused on speed-became a core part of McLaren's identity.</p>

<p>Before officially using the name, McLaren sought approval from the Senna family and the Senna Foundation. 
  Both agreed, not only because the car was intended as a tribute, but also because it reflected Ayrton's values: 
  technical excellence, passion, and the constant pursuit of perfection.</p>

<p>The name "McLaren Senna" was ultimately chosen because the car, though road-legal, is designed to feel first and foremost like a track machine. 
  It was meant to be as uncompromising as Ayrton Senna's approach to racing. 
  This made it the first McLaren ever to be named after a real person-an exceptional decision and a remarkable honor.</p>

<p>Today, the McLaren Senna stands not only for extreme performance but also as a legacy: 
  a reminder of one of the greatest drivers of all time and one of the most successful eras in McLaren's history.</p>
